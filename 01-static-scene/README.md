# Static Scene

This scene is completely static. We've laid out a sample space to show off how you can use a layout from blender or a resource like [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com) to build your Decentraland scene.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
