With this Dynamic Animation, we're demonstrating how to employ simple data binding to objects in your scene. Translation, rotation, and scale are all properties you can bind to state values.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will make sure the dependencies are taken care of, and then open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about our JSX-style lifecycle and rendering in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/docs
