The interactive door shows how to handle reticle click input events from the user. The large, red dot in the center of the viewport determines which object you're currently focused on.

To open and close the door, walk over to it, target it with the red dot, and click.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about handling user inputs in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/docs
