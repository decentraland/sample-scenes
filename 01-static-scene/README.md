# Static Scene

This scene is completely static. We've laid out a sample space to show off how you can use a project from blender or a resource like [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com) to build your Decentraland scene.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to switch to that directory and type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will make sure any dependencies are installed and then open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about the different file type support in our documentation: [https://docs.decentraland.org/docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/docs)
