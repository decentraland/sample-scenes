# Static Scene

This is an example of a completely static scene. We've designed this example to demonstrate how you can use models  from blender or a resource like [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com/) to build a simple, three-dimensional environment in your Decentraland scene.

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**


Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl preview
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about building scenes in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/
