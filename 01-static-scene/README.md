# Static Scene

This is an example of a completely static scene. We've designed this example to demonstrate how you can use models  from blender or a resource like [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com/) to build a simple, three-dimensional environment in your Decentraland scene.

Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt. Run `dcl preview` to launch a new browser tab containing the scene.
