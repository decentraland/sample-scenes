# Dynamic Animation

With this Dynamic Animation, we're demonstrating how to employ simple data binding to objects in your scene. Translation, rotation, and scale are all properties you can bind with values.

To run this sample scene, run `npm install` to build the project, then `dcl preview` to see it in action.

You can learn more about our JSX-style rendering in our documentation: [https://docs.decentraland.org/docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/docs)
