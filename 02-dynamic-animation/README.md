# Dynamic Animation

With this Dynamic Animation, we're demonstrating how to employ simple data binding to objects in your scene. Translation, rotation, and scale are all attributes you can bind to `state` properties.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to switch to that directory and type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will make sure any dependencies are installed and then open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about our JSX-style lifecycle and rendering in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/
