In your scenes, you can load up an interactive GLTF model and trigger its animations. This is an example of how to do that.

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about this feature in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/docs
