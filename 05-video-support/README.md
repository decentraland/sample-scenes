# Video Support

Here is a rudimentary example of video playback from both an external and local video source. Click on the screens to play and stop the videos. One of them runs from a local source, the other from an external source.

You can learn more about this feature in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/.

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**


Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl preview
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
