# Video Support

Here is a rudimentary example of video playback from both an external and local video source.  A more complete sample will be forthcoming with the SDK update to [babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

Once you've got the CLI installed, to view the scene, you only need to type `dcl preview` at the command prompt. It will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

You can learn more about this feature in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/
