# Dynamic Animation

With this Dynamic Animation, we're demonstrating how to employ simple data binding to objects in your scene. Translation, rotation, and scale are all attributes you can bind to `state` properties.

You can learn more about our JSX-style lifecycle and rendering in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/


**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**


Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl preview
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
